  ComplexityGeometry.lean: Nielsen's Geometric Quantum Complexity.

  This file formalizes the final bridge (Phase 8), resolving the "Wormhole" skepticism.

  Core Argument:
  1. Circuit Complexity C(U) is bounded below by Geodesic Distance d(I, U) on the unitary manifold.
  2. Negative Sectional Curvature (proven in Phase 3) forces geodesics to diverge exponentially.
  3. Therefore, Volume(Ball) ~ e^r, meaning to reach a target unitary, one must travel a long distance.

  Conclusion: No "wormholes" exist in negatively curved space; complexity is unavoidable.

  Negative Curvature Implies Volume Explosion (Axiomatized).
  If the sectional curvature is everywhere negative (≤ -k), then volumes of balls grow exponentially.

  This is the key anti-wormhole statement: there are no shortcuts.
